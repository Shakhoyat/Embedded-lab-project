## Technical Implementation

### Components
- `EnhancedSmartBuildingMonitor.jsx`: Main enhanced dashboard with manager controls
- `NotificationManager.jsx`: Advanced notification management system
- `EmergencyOverlay.jsx`: Full-screen fire emergency interface
- `SmartBuildingMonitor.jsx`: Core monitoring dashboard (enhanced with callbacks)

### Dependencies
- React 19.1.1
- Firebase 12.4.0
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.18

### Audio Assets Required
Place these audio files in `/public/sounds/`:
- `emergency-siren.mp3`: Fire emergency alarm
- `warning-beep.mp3`: Warning alert sound
- `acknowledgment.mp3`: Confirmation sound

### Icon Assets Required
Place these icon files in `/public/`:
- `fire-emergency-icon.png`: Fire emergency notification icon
- `fire-badge.png`: Notification badge icon

## Manager Authentication
For demonstration purposes, use these credentials:
- **Username**: `manager`
- **Password**: `emergency123`

In a production environment, implement proper authentication with:
- Secure password hashing
- Multi-factor authentication
- Role-based access controls
- Session management

## Firebase Integration
The system saves emergency data to these Firebase paths:
- `/smartBuilding/managerAlerts`: Manager-specific emergency alerts
- `/smartBuilding/alerts`: General system alerts
- `/smartBuilding/emergency_notifications`: Fire brigade notifications

## Browser Compatibility
- Requires modern browser with Web Notifications API support
- Works best with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Mobile responsive design for tablet/phone access

## Emergency Testing
To test the emergency system:
1. Enable Manager Mode
2. Trigger a fire condition in the Arduino system
3. Observe the notification workflow
4. Test acknowledgment and dispatch functions

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: In a real emergency, always follow proper evacuation procedures and contact emergency services immediately.
