- Add more zones easily
- Each zone independent
- Cloud aggregates all data

**Result:** Scales from apartment to entire building!

### 3. **Professional Web Interface** 💎
- 3D building visualization
- Real-time updates
- Historical charts
- Mobile responsive

**Result:** Looks like a commercial product!

### 4. **Automated Emergency Response** 🚨
